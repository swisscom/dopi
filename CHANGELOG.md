## [0.16.0] - 2017-02-22

IMPORTANT: the config file which used to be under /etc/dop/dopi.conf is now under /etc/dop/dop.conf
because it will now be used by all dop projects and not just by dopi. Make sure you adjust your
installation when updating to > 0.16.

### Added
- it is now possible to include other files in the plan. by using include: path/to/file.yaml

### Added
- The reboot command of the ssh/reboot plugin can now be adjusted with 'reboot_cmd'

- Assign a proper pty to stdin of processes to prevent the tcgetattr errors of some platforms

## [0.14.1] - 2016-11-16

- Fixes to the content loader from an executable from dop_common

## [0.14.0] - 2016-11-09

WARNING: This version introduces a new plan store which is incompatible with the old plan store. If you used the plan store of DOPi you will have to re-add all your plans with the new version. There is no automatic migration.

WARNING: The state update feature is in a very early version and there may be corner cases where it does not work as expected. Please always make sure to check the state after an update to verify if the update did what you expected. If you encounter such a case please file a bug report. A workaround is to update the plan with the "--clear" switch which will reset the state, which resembles the old behavior.

### Changed
- Complete re-implementation of the plan store
- Implementation of a proper plan cache to speed up hiera lookups
- The state of a plan will now be updated if a plan is updated
- Complete re-implementation of the state store, which now has a write lock, transactions and atomic updates.
- The update command has a new syntax and the new options clear and ignore to influence how the state should be updated in the case of an error
- remove will now just remove the plan but the state will be preserved
- The show command will now collapse steps per default and only show partial or running steps as expanded. There is a new switch "detailed" to show the full tree
- The show command has a new curses UI for the follow function which will update automatically with inotify if the state changes
- Complete rewrite of the DOPi library API

## Added
- It is now possible to set a title for a command to get a more meaningful output in the show command

## [0.13.1] - 2016-08-10

### Fixed
- Dopi sometimes still tried to access /var/lib/dop when running as a user
- Dopi failed on ruby 2.2 when running a plan from the plan cache
- Plugin timeout did not terminate the processes correctly

## [0.13.0] - 2016-06-22

### Added
- New operation_timeout setting for the winrm connector for long running commands
- The very essential winrm/reboot plugin
- The winrm/puppet_agent plugin

### Fixed
- A run will now stop in the middle of a command sets if an stop command was sent
- winrm/file_exists and winrm/file_contains should now work with paths with spaces
- stderr was not returned correctly for parsing in the winrm connector

### Changed
- Migration of the winrm plugins to the new modularized format
- Update winrm gem to the newest version

## [0.12.0] - 2016-06-13

This release has some pretty significant changes to the SSH connector. It will now encode
the command into a base64 string which will then be decoded on the server side. This should
prevent a lot of the headache around escaping and allow for multiline scripts.

Stuff like this should now be possible:

    - name: 'Execute muliline script'
      nodes: 'all'
      command:
        plugin: 'ssh/custom'
        exec: |
          export FOO="a multiline script"
          echo "this is ${FOO}"
          echo "we don't care about escaping anymore" > /tmp/sometext
          cat /tmp/sometext

You can still get the old behaviour if you set "base64: false" in an ssh plugins. However I
recommend you migrate your scripts instead, which should also make the script look cleaner.

There are also some other smaller changes to the ssh connector which are listed below.

### Changed
- ssh now uses base64 to enable multiline commands and to fix the issues with escaping
- the ssh_check_host_key cli option has gone away. This is now a plugin setting and can
  now be set with the set_plugin_defaults or per plugin instance, which is much more flexible.

### Added
- ssh/reboot plugin

## [0.11.1] - 2016-06-09
- upgrade of dop_common

## [0.11.0] - 2016-05-25
### Added

  This can be set per plan and be overwritten by step

### Removed
- plan subhash for max_in_flight is no longer supported and was removed
- Setting the ssh password via ssh_root_pass is no longer supported and was removed

## [0.10.1] - 2016-04-27

## [0.10.0] - 2016-04-18
### Added
- plugin ssh/file_deploy to deploy files to a node

## [0.9.1] - 2016-02-15
### Fixed

## [0.9.0] - 2016-01-27
### Added
- Dopi will now support the loading of secrets like passwords from external sources like files
  and the output of executables. See the dop_common documentation for more information.

### Changed
- Dopi will now detect a lot more typos in the node selection via nodes, roles or config
  in the steps or on the cli when running a plan.
- Dopi will now only print warnings instead of trowing an error if a node or role does not
  exist or a pattern does not match anything in a step or on the cli.
- Dopi will now use different default directories and config locations if run by a user so the
  program can actually write to all the necessary files and directories per default.

### Fixed
- Dopi will no longer crash but print an error if the credentials list of a plugin is empty.
- Dopi will no longer crash but print an error if the hiera.yaml is not present.
